# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day.

## Description

The Work Day Scheduler is a web application that allows users to create and manage their daily schedule. Users can enter events or tasks for each hour of the standard business day (9am to 5pm) and save them locally using the browser's local storage.
